Tabu Search Based Metaheuristic Local Search Algorithm for the PASU problem
===========================================================================

Patient Allocation Scheduling with Uncertainty (PASU) problem is a NP-Complete combinatorial optimization problem. It is a dynamic version of the Patient Admission Scheduling(PAS) problem.

The PAS problem aims to support the decision-making process in hospitals. The Dynamic PAS problem extends the original to be more comprehensive by taking the possibility of admission delay and the risk of overstaying. 

This program assigns patients to ward beds automatically using a tabu search-based metaheuristic algorithm, taking into account both the medical requirements and the ward preferences of patients. The aim of this paper is to propose a method for patient admission scheduling process in order to maximize the efficiency of medical treatment, the satisfaction of in-patients, and the cost of hospital operation and management.

I proposed a tabu search based metaheuristic local search algorithm for the specific problem. The components of the algorithm mainly include search space, initial solution, cost function, tabu list, aspiration criteria, neighborhood solution selection, neighborhood move, and termination criteria.
